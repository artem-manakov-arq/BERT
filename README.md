I. Run BERT via Google Colab (the simplest way):

  Open URL: http://colab.research.google.com/github/artem-manakov-arq/BERT/blob/master/BERT.Regime_2.ipynb

  Menu Runtime -> Run All (or press Ctrl+F9)

  Agree to reset all runtimes if needed

  Wait for downloading model and all imports

  Change input strings (sentence, sentence_1 and sentence_2) and press Play button left side to recalculate only current cell (or press Ctrl+Enter)
